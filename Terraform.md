### **Topics Covered**  

1. **Introduction to Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**
   - Definition and significance of IaC in modern DevOps practices.  

2. **Overview of Terraform**
   - What is Terraform?  
   - Key benefits of using Terraform for IaC.  

3. **Installation**
   - Step-by-step guide for installing Terraform on:  
     - **Windows**  
     - **Mac**  
     - **Linux**  

4. **Creating a Terraform Project**
   - Setting up project directories and creating configuration files.  
   - Selecting providers and writing the initial configuration (e.g., `main.tf`).  

5. **Running Terraform Commands**  
   - `terraform init`, `terraform plan`, and `terraform apply` commands.  
   - Formatting configurations with `terraform fmt`.  
   - Understanding state files (`terraform.tfstate`) and the `terraform show` command.  
   - Cleaning up with `terraform destroy`.  

6. **Terraform Variables, Outputs, and Modules**
   - Creating and using `variables.tf` and `terraform.tfvars`.  
   - Defining outputs in `outputs.tf`.  
   - Organizing reusable code using modules.  

7. **Managing Environments and Workspaces**
   - Using folder structures for environments.  
   - Managing multiple workspaces efficiently.  

8. **Best Practices for Terraform Projects**
