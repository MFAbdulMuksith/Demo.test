Conclusion

Your diet is rich in proteins and healthy fats, with a good balance of complex carbohydrates and fiber. You're getting plenty of vitamins and minerals from whole foods, which support overall health and recovery. Your daily intake is around 2000 kcal, which should be appropriate for weight maintenance or slight weight loss, given your activity level (walking and stretching). Adjust portion sizes as needed based on energy needs or fitness goals.
