# Essential Configurations for Visual Studio Code (VSC)
I find the below basic settings very useful and hope it will be useful for you too to keep your code nice and tidy.

## 1. Insert Final Newline
It is recommended to add an empty line at the end of the file as some old tools might misbehave without it and also it helps clean code changes in git when you add something at the bottom.

*Text Editor → Files → Insert Final Newline = ☑*

## 2. Trim Trailing Whitespace
Code with trailing whitespaces doesn’t look nice especially when you review codes and removing them automatically before you commit will keep the code tidy and make your peers happy.

*Text Editor → Files → Trim Trailing Whitespace = ☑*

## 3. Auto Format Code on Save
Auto formatting code is a helpful feature to keep the code in the proper structure, indentation, etc… to do that.

*Text Editor → Formatting → Format On Save = ☑*

4. **Install Language Support:**
   - Once launched, install language-specific extensions (e.g., Python, JavaScript, Terraform, etc.) through the Extensions view (`Ctrl + Shift + X`).

---

## 3. Essential Configurations

### a. Insert Final Newline
Inserting a newline at the end of each file ensures consistent file endings across different operating systems and tools. This is a best practice in software development, preventing issues with text file processing and version control.

1. **Configuration:**
   - Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl + Shift + P`).
   - Type **"Preferences: Open Settings (JSON)"** and select it.
   - Add the following setting:
     ```json
     "files.insertFinalNewline": true
     ```
   - This setting ensures that a newline is added automatically when saving files that don't have one.

### b. Trim Trailing Whitespace
Trailing whitespace (spaces or tabs after the end of a line) can cause issues in some programming languages and tools. It’s recommended to remove trailing whitespace on save.

1. **Configuration:**
   - In the same **Settings (JSON)** file, add:
     ```json
     "files.trimTrailingWhitespace": true
     ```
   - This setting will automatically trim any trailing spaces or tabs on every file save.

### c. Auto Format Code on Save
Auto-formatting ensures that your code follows consistent formatting rules, improving readability and reducing manual formatting efforts. The *Prettier* or *ESLint* extension is typically used for this purpose.

1. **Install Prettier Extension:**
   - Go to the Extensions view (`Ctrl + Shift + X`).
   - Search for **Prettier - Code formatter** and install it.

2. **Configuration:**
   - Add the following settings to auto-format code on save:
     ```json
     "editor.formatOnSave": true,
     "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode"
     ```
   - This setting enables formatting for all supported languages when you save the file.

### d. Configure Tab Size and Indentation
VS Code uses spaces for indentation by default, but some projects might require tabs or specific indentation levels (e.g., 2 spaces or 4 spaces per indentation level).

1. **Configuration:**
   - Add the following to **Settings (JSON)** to enforce consistent indentation:
     ```json
     "editor.tabSize": 4,
     "editor.insertSpaces": true,
     "editor.detectIndentation": false
     ```
   - This configures VS Code to insert 4 spaces for every tab and disables automatic detection of indentation (helpful when working across different projects with varying styles).

### e. Enable IntelliSense and Autocomplete
IntelliSense provides smart completions based on variable types, function definitions, and imported modules, enhancing productivity.

1. **Configuration:**
   - Ensure IntelliSense is enabled with the following settings:
     ```json
     "editor.quickSuggestions": {
       "other": true,
       "comments": false,
       "strings": true
     },
     "editor.suggestOnTriggerCharacters": true,
     "editor.parameterHints.enabled": true
     ```
   - These settings provide auto-complete suggestions and parameter hints as you type.

### f. Sync Settings Across Devices
For developers working on multiple machines, VS Code’s *Settings Sync* feature can automatically synchronize extensions, themes, and settings across devices.

   - Type **"Add Configuration"** and select Node.js.
   - This creates a `launch.json` file under the `.vscode` directory:
     ```json
     {
       "version": "0.2.0",
       "configurations": [
         {
           "type": "node",
           "request": "launch",
           "name": "Launch Program",
           "skipFiles": ["<node_internals>/**"],
           "program": "${workspaceFolder}/app.js"
         }
       ]
     }
     ```

## 6. Task Automation and Workspace Management

### a. Task Automation
VS Code allows you to automate repetitive tasks like running builds, tests, or custom commands.

1. **Create Task (tasks.json):**
   - In the `.vscode` folder, create a `tasks.json` file:
     ```json
     {
       "version": "2.0.0",
       "tasks": [
         {
           "label": "npm: build",
           "type": "shell",
           "command": "npm run build",
           "problemMatcher": [],
           "group": {
             "kind": "build",
             "isDefault": true
           }
         }
       ]
     }
     ```

### b. Multi-root Workspaces
If you work on multiple projects, multi-root workspaces allow you to manage them in one VS Code instance.

1. **Create Multi-root Workspace:**
   - Open multiple folders via `File > Add Folder to Workspace`.
   - Save the workspace configuration (`File > Save Workspace As`).
